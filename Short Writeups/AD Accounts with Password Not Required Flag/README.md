# Summary

The *"PASSWD_NOTREQD"* flag is a specific attribute that can be set on user accounts. This attribute is part of the **`userAccountControl`** property, which is a bit field containing several flags that determine various settings and behaviors of user accounts.

The *"PASSWD_NOTREQD"* flag corresponds to the decimal value **`544`** within the **`userAccountControl`** attribute of an Active Directory user object. When this value is set, it indicates that the user account is allowed to exist without a password. This does not automatically remove a password if one exists but allows the account to have a blank password.

# Why might it be used in Active Directory?

The article explains that accounts with the *"PASSWD_NOTREQD"* flag often arise from identity management systems that fail to remove the flag after setting a password. Although the flag allows accounts to exist with blank passwords, itâ€™s rare to find active accounts with blank passwords due to this issue.

After googling around, I did saw some examples of people mentioning this:

According to the Microsoft article, there's no direct interface to query accounts with blank passwords. However, you can write a PowerShell script that identifies accounts with the *"PASSWD_NOTREQD"* flag and then use **`runas.exe`** to test if you can authenticate without a password. This approach effectively checks for accounts that might have blank passwords by attempting to log in without a password.
